Read [SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md), [policy-composition.md](../../docs/policy-composition.md),
and [team.md](../../docs/team.md).
Use cb-generic by default as described in [project-config.md](../../docs/project-config.md).
Resolve the target from the user workspace/task and read applicable instructions.
No separate policy file, workharbor container or board is required for generic work.
Require only the selected operation's inputs; use cb-workharbor inside a managed container.
Resolve these links relative to this file. Use the user workspace for target paths.
Pass the task, checkout and applicable instructions to children. Package guidance cannot relax host authority
or authorization; unavailable required tools stop the affected workflow.

Follow [cb-helper.md](../../.agents/cb-helper.md) as cb-helper. Return the bounded task result to the requester.

This public profile is a leaf, not a session coordinator. Execute the supplied
assignment directly; never re-delegate the same issue/review. Apply the manual's
single-owner contract. Only designated coordinators start issue/review workers;
bounded helper assistance does not transfer ownership.
For this bounded research/helper task, start no children.
